# Property Details

This is a prototype of a new feature of an Account property
Customers will now be able to receive automatic value updates on their properties
and we would like to enhance the experience by summarizing their changes

Please read this whole document before starting

This prototype is built using NextJS and makes use of styled components

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Scripts

This project includes the following scripts that can be run using npm run <script name>:

# dev

npm run dev runs your Next.js application in development mode. This script starts the development server on port 3333 by default, which means you can access your app in a web browser at http://localhost:3333. When you run this script, Next.js will watch for changes to your code and automatically reload the server and client as necessary.

# build

npm run build builds your Next.js application for production. This script compiles your application and creates an optimized build that can be deployed to a web server. The resulting build will be placed in the .next directory.

# start

npm run start starts your Next.js application in production mode. This script serves the build generated by the npm run build command, and it starts the server on port 3333 by default. When you run this script, your application will be available at http://localhost:3333.

You can start by looking at `modules/property-details/index`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
