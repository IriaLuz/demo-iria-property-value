# Property Details

This document outlines the details for a new feature of an Account property. Customers will now receive automatic value updates on their properties, and we aim to enhance their experience by summarizing their changes. Please read this entire document before starting.

This prototype is built using NextJS and makes use of styled components

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Scripts

This project includes the following scripts that can be run using `npm run <script name>`:

### build

`npm run build` will build your Next.js application for production. This script compiles your application and creates an optimized build that can be deployed to a web server. The resulting build will be placed in the `.next` directory.

### start

`npm run start` will start your Next.js application in production mode. This script serves the build generated by the `npm run build` command, and it starts the server on port 3333 by default. When you run this script, your application will be available at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

### test

The `test` command is used to run the Jest test runner on your project. This command is configured in the `package.json` file.

- `--watch`: This flag tells Jest to watch for file changes and re-run the tests when changes occur.

## Future Improvements

Here are some suggestions for future improvements to this prototype:

- Set up linters and pre-commit hooks
- Add ARIA attributes to provide additional information to assistive technologies
- Implement UX or design improvements
- Use more color contrast to improve accessibility. The app currently has an accessibility score of 87% on Lighthouse, which could be improved by using better color contrast for the text and buttons. The background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
